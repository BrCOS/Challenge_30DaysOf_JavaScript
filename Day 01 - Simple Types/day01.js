let lastName = 'Costa'; //that's how we declare variables

// let vs var

var fullName = 'Bruno Costa'; //they are pretty much the same, but the 'var' declares it on a global level
                                //even if declared inside of a scope (function) as a temp variable
                                //so, always use let

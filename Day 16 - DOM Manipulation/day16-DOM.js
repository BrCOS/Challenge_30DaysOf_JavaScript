// the dom
//tags and structure that they provide tells the browser how to render the page

//loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM), this means that the browser takes
//the HTML and converts it into a model of the page that is able to render

//the HTML that we write and gets displayed never changes no matter what we do with the JS
//that is because the js doesn't change the HTML (that we see), it changes the DOM (thing your browser creats)

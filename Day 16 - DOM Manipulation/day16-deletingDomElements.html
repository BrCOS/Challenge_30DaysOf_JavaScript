        //so we passing the <ul> and storing it in the todos const
        //the while loop will run until todo.hasNodes() returns false, and false means that we have deleted them all because
        //there are non left so it returns false

        //and each iteration of the while loop, deletets the first element in the children
        //so, each time we delete one children the loop rechecks hasChildNodes() and it runs again until is empty

        //we can't use forEach, because it only works on arrays, and todo.children is not an array, it's an object

        //there is a safer way to deleting all children, we just need to change one thing:
        //todos.removeChild(todos.lastChild); (rememver to keep the while loop, just change this one line)
        //this one will remove the last child of the list until there isn't a first child anymore

// functions
//they are a block of code wrapped up in a way to make them reusable
//they work the just like python's functions, no biggie

function sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello');
}

sayHello();//don't forget to call them

//the code inside a function doesn't 'leak' into the rest of the code
//it's possible to import a funciton from another js file


// no input no return
//same function as above

//in the () is where the inputs will go
//in the {} is the code that run, when we call the function

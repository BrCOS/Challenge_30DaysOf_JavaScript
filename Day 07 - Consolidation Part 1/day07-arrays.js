// arrays
//are used to store a list of items

const weights = [12, 55, 98];
const cities = ['London', 'Paris', 'Bangkok'];

//we can mix types in arrays but it's not recommended
//we access an array value by its index

console.log(cities[0])//prints London

//it has its methods too

console.log(cities.length);//prints 3

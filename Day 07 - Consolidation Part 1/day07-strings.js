// strings
//just like everything in js, strings are objects and they have functions
//who are known as methods, that we can call

const myString = '   Hello World   ';

const lowerCased = myString.toLowerCase();
const removeWhiteSpaces = myString.trim();
const manyStrings = myString.repeat(4);
const stringLength = myString.length;//the only method that it's not a function
//but rather a property to be read, like if it was a value, which if you think
//about it kind of is, like, the value of the length

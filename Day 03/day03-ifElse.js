// if else statements
//if has an counterpart called else, which will run in case the statement is false
//let's rewrite our first code of the day using else and more stuff that we learned today

if (happy) { //here, we can use the implicity code, because we are dealing with a boolean type
    console.log('Happy');
} else { //the else block doesn't need a condition between parantheses, because it will run when
    console.log('Not Happy') //the if condition is false
}

//just remember, it can be an if without an else, but that can't be an else without an if

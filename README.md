# Challenge_30DaysOf_JavaScript

## What is this challenge?

30 days of JS is a course that will help us learn the basic of JS in just 30 days.

So, basically, the challenge is to actually do the 30 days that I'm suppoused to do.

More information about this course can be found here: https://allthecode.co/courses/30-days-of-javascript/intro

## How Does It Works?

So, I have a folder here with 30 (actually 29) days, and each day I learned something new about JS (and a bit of HTML and CSS as well).

Each day contains a `README.md` file that you can read to get a peek at what I learned that day.
